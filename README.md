# QUIZ GAME PROJECT

## It is a small Quiz gmae project.

It Starts by asking a question whether players are interested to start a game or not. If they are ready to start, then by replying yes the quiz starts.

If players type no or any other keyword, then the game quits.

It has total 3 questions. For every question, there is a score of 1 point. Players can type there answer in upper or lower cases. The lower method in python converts the answer of players into 
lower case.

At the end of quiz, players can see how much score they got ( both in points and percentages ).
